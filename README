starter - POSIX shell script and function to schedule commands

WARNING: Unless you have a special reason, use instead the successor project
	https://github.com/vaeth/schedule

This script can be used to schedule commands in a multitasking
and multiuser environment.

Commands started with this script will wait with the execution
until all commands started earlier with this script
(possibly by a different user) have been executed.

You can also have several of such command queues or add a command
to a queue even if you start it immediately.

For installation, copy the content of bin/ in your path.
You also need push.sh from https://github.com/vaeth/push in your path.
If you want that the hard status line is set, also the title script from
https://github.com/vaeth/runtitle (version >=2.3) is required in your path.
To obtain support for zsh completion, you can copy the content of zsh/
to a directory of zsh's $fpath.
For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).

To get help about the usage, call
	starter -h

There is also a starter_trap function available for execution of
commands within your current shell. To obtain this function use either

eval `starter_trap`

or

. starter_trap

in your current shell or put the following into your shell startup files:

starter_trap() {
	if starter_trap=`starter_trap 2>/dev/null`
	then	eval "$starter_trap"
	else	echo "starter_trap not found" >&2
		return 1
	fi
	starter_trap ${1+"$@"}
}

Information about the starter_trap function can then be obtained with

starter_trap -h
