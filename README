starter - POSIX shell script and function to schedule commands

This script can be used to schedule commands in a multitasking
and multiuser environment.

Commands started with this script will wait with the execution
until all commands started earlier with this script
(possibly by a different user) have been executed.

You can also have several of such command queues or add a command
to a queue even if you start it immediately.

For installation, copy the content of bin/ in your path.

To get help about the usage, call
	starter -h

To define the starter_trap function for execution of commands within your
current shell, call
	. starter_trap
Information about the starter_trap function can then be obtained with
	starter_trap -h

To obtain support for zsh completion, you can copy the content of zsh/
to a directory of zsh's $fpath.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
