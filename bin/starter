	Echo "Usage: ${0##*/} [options] COMMAND [args for COMMAND]
Wait until all commands started before by \"${0##*/}\" (or which are waiting)
are finished and then start COMMAND. Note that COMMAND may be \"eval\" in
which case the args can be almost any POSIX shell code.
If no locking functionality failed, the exit status is that of COMMAND.

(If you want an analogous functionality for several commands in your current
shell you might want to use the starter_trap function; use \". starter_trap\"
to define that function and \"starter_trap -h\" to print its description.)

The following options are available:
-i      Start command immediately (but increase the number of commands in
        the queue anyway while the command is run).
-w      Do not start any command, only wait (or execute -d/S/0/Z).
        This is similar, but more efficient, to using a \"dummy\" command.
-v      Verbose: If not starting, report to stderr how many processes are
        running and waiting.
-q      Quiet: Do not print warnings.
-S      If command finishes unsuccessfully (with nonzero exit status)
        or if used together with option -w, treat queue as if command would
        never finish. Note that this means that the rest of the queue
        is *never* executed unless ${0##*/} is called afterwards with the
        option -d (or -0/Z).
-d      Decrease the number of commands in the queue by 1 (before waiting).
        This might be necessary if a ${0##*/} process died unexpectedly
        or if the -S option was used.
-0 or z Set the number of processes to 0 (in the queue).
-Z      Set the number of processes to 0 in all queues.
        You should use this when you use ${0##*/} for the first time
        after a reboot (when perhaps not all processes of a queue had been
        finished before in a regular manner)
-p      Print the number of currently running/waiting processes in the queue
        and exit.
-P      Print the number of currently running/waiting processes and the
        number of currently waiting processes in the queue and exit.
-c NAME Use queue NAME. Current value: ${queuename}
-s TIME Sleep TIME between new checks of the queue. TIME is used as an
        argument to sleep (type \"man sleep\" for details).
        Current value: ${sleeptime}
-u xxx  Use umask xxx to create the queue and lock FILEs.
        This defaults to your current umask (or 000 if STARTER=unsafe).
        Current value: ${myumask:-current umask}
-t DIR  Use DIR as tempdir to store FILE and FILE.lock; this is ignored if
        option -f is used. Default is \$STARTER_DIR if set, otherwise \$HOME
        (or /tmp with STARTER=unsafe).
        Current value: ${tempdir}
-f FILE Use FILE and FILE.lock for queues and locking, respectively.
        FILE must be an absolute path. Defaults to: 'tempdir/${0##*/}.queues'
        Current value: ${fileprint}

Security notes:

!!! If STARTER_DIR (or -t) is a directory which is not only writable by you,
running this script makes you vulnerable to symlink attacks !!!

With STARTER=unsafe, the defaults are chosen such that processes of arbitrary
users can wait for each other.
This has severe security implications, only one being obvious:
A malevolent user can modify the queues so that your waiting process will never
start or that \"${0##*/}\" returns with an error or never gets a lockfile.

However, since the names of FILE and FILE.lock must be known and reside in a
world-writable directory, a malevolent user can also start symlink attacks
which can indirectly modify your files.

Thus, use STARTER=unsafe only in a true single-valued environment and
if you understand these implications.

It is preferable to share queues only with trusted user(s): Create a directory
writable only by this user/group and set STARTER_DIR to that directory.
Nevertheless, the users from this group can still start symlink attacks."
