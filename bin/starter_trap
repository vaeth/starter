'Usage: starter_trap start [further options for "starter"]
or     starter_trap stop

This function should first be called with argument "start"; then any shell
commands can be executed, and afterwards this function should be called with
argument "stop".  Your shell behaves then as if the shell commands would
have been put in a script which would have been called with "starter".

Technical details: "start" essentially is a call to "starter -Sw"
which increases the number of processes in the starter queue by 1.
Moreover, traps EXIT HUP INT TERM are set correspondingly such that this number
is decreased again with "starter -idw" in case of an unexpected exit
during the further shell commands (this is the reason why this script
must be sourced). "stop" does essentially the same as this trap.
The additional options to "starter" are used in both calls to ensure that
e.g. the same queue and queue files are used.

The further options for "starter" are not checked for consistency.
Spaces in these arguments are OK, but other special characters may produce
unexpected results unless bash >= 3 is used.

Note that shell variables/functions of the form starter_trap_* might be
modified by this function.'
